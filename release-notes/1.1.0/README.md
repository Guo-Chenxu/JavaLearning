## üåü Detailed Description of Key Features

Here are detailed explanations of the important features and improvements in this release:

### 1. Ci

**Related PR**: [#11](https://github.com/Guo-Chenxu/JavaLearning/pull/11) | **Contributor**: [Guo-Chenxu](https://github.com/Guo-Chenxu)

**Usage Background**

This PR mainly focuses on optimizing cleanup and configuration issues within the CI/CD workflow. During the continuous integration process, temporary files such as report.md and report.EN.md, as well as unnecessary directories like github-mcp-server, are often left behind. Additionally, inconsistent secret names (secrets.TOKEN) used in the original PR may cause permission issues or build failures. These problems affect the efficiency and stability of the automated process, so it is necessary to clean up and correct the CI workflow.

**Feature Description**

This PR modifies the GitHub Actions workflow file by adding operations to delete temporary files (report.md, report.EN.md) and unnecessary directories (github-mcp-server). It also changes the previously used secret name from secrets.TOKEN to secrets.GITUHB_TOKEN (which may be a typo). These changes reduce redundant files in the build process, improve the cleanliness of the workflow, and resolve potential issues with secret usage. Although no new features were introduced, the code structure optimization enhances the overall robustness of the CI process.

**Usage Method**

This PR is part of internal CI process optimization and does not require active activation or configuration by the user. It is suitable for enterprise or developer teams using GitHub Actions for automated builds and releases. Typical scenarios include automatically generating and submitting release notes during each version release, ensuring a clean and residue-free release process. Best practices include keeping the CI workflow concise, avoiding unnecessary files and dependencies, to improve build efficiency and maintainability.

**Feature Value**

This PR enhances the stability and security of the CI process by cleaning up temporary files and fixing secret configurations. It reduces redundant content in the build environment, lowers the risk of errors, and improves the reliability of the automated process. For projects that rely on CI/CD for version releases, this optimization helps improve development efficiency, reduce manual intervention, and ensure consistency in the release process. Additionally, fixing the secret name error avoids build failures caused by permission issues, further ensuring the project's sustainable operation.

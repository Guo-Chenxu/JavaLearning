## üåü Detailed Description of Key Features

Here are detailed explanations of the key features and improvements in this release:

### 1. Ci

**Related PR**: [#11](https://github.com/Guo-Chenxu/JavaLearning/pull/11) | **Contributor**: [Guo-Chenxu](https://github.com/Guo-Chenxu)

**Usage Background**

This PR mainly focuses on optimizing the cleanup steps and security configurations in the CI/CD process. In previous workflows, there were leftover temporary files and outdated or insecure key configurations, which could lead to build failures or security risks. This change aims to enhance the robustness of the automated workflow, ensuring that resources are cleanly released after each build and using a more secure key management approach. It is suitable for all developers who rely on GitHub Actions for continuous integration.

**Feature Details**

This PR modifies the GitHub Actions workflow file by adding cleanup operations for `report.md`, `report.EN.md`, and the `github-mcp-server` directory. Additionally, it changes the token used to create PRs from `secrets.TOKEN` to `secrets.GITUHB_TOKEN` (which may be a typo correction). These changes are part of the CI process refactoring and optimization. By removing unnecessary residual files and updating security configurations, the reliability and security of the workflow are enhanced. Furthermore, the code changes involve maintenance improvements of the CI scripts rather than new feature implementations, so they fall under the refactor category.

**Usage Method**

This feature requires no additional configuration from users; it only affects the execution of the CI process. Developers can benefit from a more stable build environment without any actions. Typical scenarios include automatically generating and submitting release notes during project releases, avoiding conflicts or build failures caused by old file residues. It is recommended to regularly check and optimize workflow configurations when using GitHub Actions for CI/CD to maintain best practices. Note: If your project still uses `secrets.TOKEN`, you should adjust it according to your actual configuration to ensure the correctness of the secret.

**Feature Value**

This PR significantly improves the stability and security of the CI process by cleaning up unnecessary files and fixing key configurations, reducing the risk of build failures. For teams relying on GitHub Actions for automated deployment, this helps improve development efficiency and reduce human errors. At the same time, standardized key management aligns with modern DevOps best practices, enhancing the maintainability and scalability of the entire project. For open-source projects, such optimizations can also improve the experience of community contributors, making the build process more transparent and controllable.
